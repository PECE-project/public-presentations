## Infrastructuring Collaborative Hermeneutics: Databasing Double Bind while Pursuing PECE

### Goethe University Frankfurt, Germany

#### February 7, 2024

In this talk, I will narrate the tensions of designing the Platform for Experimental Collaborative Ethnography (PECE) - a software distribution for supporting multi-sited and multi-perspectival ethnographic research. In particular, I will discuss the architectural challenges to designing data storage systems, interfaces, and workflows that foster collaborative analysis while leaving ethnographic data open to productive reinterpretation.

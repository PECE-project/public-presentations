## ...an experiment in collaborative hermeneutics

As with any PECE talk, we are going to start with an experiment. We're going to start with a short activity to get us thinking about the affordances of PECE.

pollev

So in this activity, you just engaged in a form of collaborative hermeneutics that has guided the ways that we think about PECE architecture.

In this activity, there is a common artifact: the quote; and a common qualitative question. Yet different individuals in different disciplines may bring radically different interpretations to this question. The question was "lightly structured" - open to different renderings. It was mutable. People might bring different perceptions of what counts as a sentiment or what even counts as a discipline.

... in asking this question I was not aiming to settle on the one right way of representing disciplinary data culture; instead I am aiming to multiply the perspectives that we may bring to the study of the question. To thicken our perceptions by opening up interpretive possibilities. I left the poll open-ended but character delimited for specific reasons - to provide some bounds for answering without locking people into a common vocabulary.

## Agenda

-   History/background on PECE
-   Information Architecture
-   Inverting PECE
    -   Ethnography
    -   Collaborative
    -   Experimental
    -   Platform

::: notes
In this talk, my goal is to show the challenges - the tensions of designing information architecture for this kind of open-ended hermeneutic analysis. I will start by providing some history/background on PECE. Then I will go on to provide a "backstage" look at the commitments that we brought to the design of PECE, analyzing how they shaped our approach to the system's design. I will specifically try to highlight the tensions - the moments where there were incongruencies between our commitments and the existing digital systems available to us. ...also moments where there were incongruencies between our commitments - when it was difficult for us to meet conflicting demands. ...and while this will highlight lingering challenges that we are constantly grappling with when it comes to designing PECE, I will close with stories that demonstrate what keeps us going. ...stories of the PECE use cases that inspire us and that demonstrate what a commitment to experimentalism can look like.

::: notes
So I've been working on the Platform for Experimental Collaborative Ethnography (PECE) for over a decade. I started as an undergraduate student - at a time before PECE was called PECE. At the time, anthropologists Kim and Mike Fortun were working to imagine the design of a digital system that could facilitate international ethnographic research on asthma - a project known as The Asthma Files. At a basic level, there was a need to archive empirical ethnographic materials that were being generated in different cities - research reports, interviews, images of smog - and make them available for cross-site analysis.

::: notes
This was right around the time that the Fortuns were serving as editors for the Cultural Anthropology journal and considering what it meant to move to open access publishing models - to confront the politics of privatized knowledge production. With a focus on archiving this data for collaborative analysis, there was an interest in extending considerations around "openness" to anthropological data. What insights can we gain by making visible the often invisible work of ethnography? How can we make anthropological theorizing and interpretation less individualistic through creative digital publishing? ....of course remaining always attentive to the politics of protecting sensitive information - of sustaining confidentiality and anonymity

##  {background-image="img/cities.png"  background-size=1200px"}

::: notes
While archiving empirical data was an important component of The Asthma Files, it was not the sole component, nor was it the component where they saw the greatest potential for experimentation. There is a real risk to studying asthma in six different cities that they would end up with six different ethnographic accounts - one per city - localizing theory to particular sites. Digital architecture encourages this. Check out this early rendering of the PECE UI - there is a page per city. Click through to that page, and you will find the empirical data associated with that space. In thinking about the possibilities of digital architecture, there was a question about how it could be leveraged and configured to disrupt the tendencies to examine research data in site-specific ways. How could digital infrastructure facilitate cross-site comparative analysis? Because of the tendencies of digital systems to bucket data into categories, It was this component that demanded critical attention to information architecture. ...and this is where I came in.

Before I became involved, The Asthma Files was stored on a floppy disk - shared amongst researchers. Eventually it moved to a wiki, and then to a website - built on top of a content management system called Plone. When we realized that developers for Plone were very difficult to come by, we moved the site to Drupal, migrating all of the content stored there with us.

##  {background-image="img/disaster.png"  background-size="1200px"}

As we saw the need for this kind of digital infrastructure for many different projects (not just The Asthma Files), the base infrastructure for that Drupal website was simply copied. We had one copy for a research project studying Disaster in different contexts,

another for studying our own efforts to open ethnographic research data. As we were building out the UI in new ways, every website had to be manually updated. In the early days, we would keep multiple browser windows open, making sure that every change made it into every site. If there was a change to the way we organized the menus or the links on the front page, that had to be changed on several different sites.

##  {background-image="img/github.png"  background-size="1200px"}

In 2015, we got some seed funding that allowed us to hire some Web developers to shift from a series of copied platforms to a standardized software distribution - one published on GitHub that any research group could download and install to a server to build out their own instance of the platform

##  {background-image="img/data_model.jpeg"  background-size="800px"}

This was an opportunity to reimagine the design of the system's data model - or the kinds of data that could be added to the platform and how those data related to one another.

:::

##  {background-image="img/ia.png"  background-size="800px"}

::: notes
It was also an opportunity to reimagine pathways into the data; how did we want people to move through the site? What kinds of engagements did we want to encourage and discourage?

Now the Fortuns and other members of the PECE design team had been thinking about the logics of the digital system - what kinds of ideological commitments they wanted it to embody - for a long time. ...but for me personally, this was the moment that I really started thinking about how those logics would be realized through the system's digital architecture. ...and so I will note now that I'm about to make a transition - from presenting background information on PECE to discussing the theorization that has motivated the design of PECE.

## WWW as Information Architecture

![](img/hypertext.jpg) 

> Image from Robert Cailliau

::: notes
Prior to joining the PECE team, I was finishing an undergraduate degree in an emerging field known as Web Science. The field was aiming to theorize how the World Wide Web became the kind of digital infrastructure that it did - how a series of protocols emerged into a complex social phenomenon. A good chunk of research in that area has thought about the social consequences of the Web's information architecture. By information architecture, I'm referring to the kind of blueprint for how people can move through digital systems - the design decisions that govern what people can access and how they get there. The WWW is a system designed via very lightweight infrastructure architecture. There is no central computer, no central organizing body dictating how pages end up on the Web or indexing content into the Web. Instead everyone - dispersed around the globe - agrees to use a standard set of protocols (HTML, etc), and then they hyperlink their content into the Web themselves. This approach was distinct from other attempts to organize content on the Internet; other approaches, like Gopher, relied on system administrators to approve content; create menus, etc. Tim Berners-Lee designed the system this way very deliberately in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
:::

## I would have to create a system with common rules that would be acceptable to everyone. This meant as close as possible to no rules at all. (Berners-Lee 1999)

::: notes
Talking about his time at CERN Berners-Lee writes:

I had seen numerous developers arrive at CERN to tout systems that "helped" people organize information. They'd say, "To use this system all you have to do is divide all your documents into four categories" or "You just have to save your data as a WordWonderful document" or whatever. I saw one protagonist after the next shot down in flames by indignant researchers because the developers were forcing them to reorganize their work to fit the system. I would have to create a system with common rules that would be acceptable to everyone. This meant as close as possible to no rules at all.
:::

##  {background-image="img/error.png" background-size="1200px"}

::: notes
Of course this system ended up quite messy. Anyone who has navigated to a web page and received a 404 error knows that without central systems to organize content on the web, you can end up with dead links and broken pages. ...but everyone that I have talked to in the Web community argues that this critical decision is why the Web "won out" over other projects. 404 is annoying but doesn't prevent you from being able to surf the Web. ...and without having to go through all of these stop-gates, without having to assign a person or institution to control how information appears on the Web, in theory anyone can participate and can participate immediately. The decision to allow for dead ends in the Web's information architecture is seen as critical for enabling this kind of work. (...and as an aside that speaks to the double binds I will eventually come to, this decision to keep things as open, light, and rule-free as possible also allows for misappropriation - for big companies like Google to sweep in and recentralize what was intended to be an essentially decentralized infrastructure).

## Infrastructurally Inverting PECE

-   E- Ethnography
-   C- Collaborative
-   E- Experimental
-   P- Platform

::: notes
Bringing this kind of perspective to the PECE design team, my role was eventually labeled Lead Platform Architect. I was responsible for thinking out what kinds of engagements would be enabled by certain configurations for the site's data model, user interfaces, search features, and menus. I was also responsible for translating the theoretical and methodological commitments of experimental ethnography into the site's architecture. I'm going to narrate some of those decisions by walking through what PECE has emerged into. ...and, drawing inspiration from Geoffrey Bowker, I'm going to do so by infrastructurally inverting the acronym - starting with the E - ethnography, and moving backwards from there to the P - platform. I'm doing this deliberately. ...because in almost all of our theorizing about PECE, we have actively avoided starting with the digital. We want to start from our commitments, and consider how the digital can help to realize those commitments. When Bowker talks about infrastructural inversion, he is referencing efforts to draw out the invisible work of infrastructural design - the backstage processes. I'm going to try and make some of that work visible here- highlighting the tensions that come along with designing architecture in this way.

So we (the PECE design team) work in a tradition of ethnography inspired by post-strucutralist and post-colonial writing emerging in the 1970s. Work that called attention to the language ideologies, structures, and tropes of seminal anthropological texts and considered how power emerged when certain communities were spoken for in ethnographic writing. Some of the most important texts inspiring our theoretical work are Clifford and Marcus Writing Culture and Marcus and Fischer’s Anthropology as Cultural Critique. These texts called on anthropologists to rethink the authority of the anthropologist’s voice, to critique tendencies to document culture in static or fixed ways, and to challenge common ways of categorizing people, sites, and theories. Sometimes referred to as the reflexive or the linguistic turn in anthropology, these writers inspired ethnographers to experiment with new ways of doing research and new ways of “writing culture.” We very much so aimed to be a part of this experiment, thinking about how we could design digital architecture to not present ethnographic data as static and fixed - even though every piece of data that enters a database gets a unique id in that database and a timestamp for when it was entered. …thinking about how we could design digital architecture to trouble categorizations that tended to homogenize the groupings they represented - even though most digital systems rely on some degree of categorization in order to present information to the public. 
:::

##  {background-image="img/design-logics.png" background-size="800px"}

::: notes
It was in this spirit that we elected to formalize our theoretical commitments into a series of “design logics” - statements that we would display on every instance of the platform outlining what we aimed for the site’s architecture to embody. In outlining each of our design logics, we have drawn from writing of anthropologists that inspire us. 
:::


##  {background-image="img/repo.png" background-size="800px"}

::: notes
Drawing from Marilyn Strathern - one of our design logics is “valuing noise” - or encouraging the collection and storage of more data than we know what to do with, more data than we could imagine becoming theoretically relevant, in recognition that the “signal” may only come at a later time - at a later stage in the analytic process. Navigate to any one instance of PECE now, and you may find the “archive” a bit dizzying. There are pages upon pages of “artifacts” - or uploaded ethnographic data points (images, interviews, videos, articles, etc), and not all of it has yet been layered into interpretive analyses. It’s not immediately clear why all of this information is relevant to the platform. Making this kind of noisy data dump infrastructurally possible was the easy part. Let users upload any kind of artifact and drop it all into one repository page. The hard part was figuring out how to facilitate without determining processes for generating signal from that data. Noisy spaces can make it difficult to find what you’re looking for - or even to find what you don’t know that you are looking for. How am I supposed to generate signal across more than 500 pages of artifacts? How can I create opportunities to stumble across artifacts that can further my ethnographic theorizing without pre-coding into the system where that data should go or what makes it meaningful? 

Addressing this meant designing creative ways into the database. From day one, I have been averse to organizing artifacts into folders. Organizing data into folders would involve coming up with a way to categorize the data, which could overdetermine how ethnographers would assign meaning to data across the platform. It could fall prey to the homogenization that the theorists we rely on warn of.
:::

##  {background-image="img/analytics.png" background-size="800px"}

::: notes
On to another design logic-
Drawing on the work of Evelyn Fox Keller, another one of our design logics prioritizes “exploratory pluralism” - rather than aiming to coverage on one interpretation of empirical ethnographic data, we seek to design a system that encourages multiple, differentially-situated interpretations, creating kaleidoscopic views of ethnographic sites rather than singular or singularly consistent ones. The structure of PECE’s annotation system was designed to realize this design logic. All artifacts in the system can be annotated. This is different than the kind of annotation that systems like MaxQDA, Atlas.ti, or NVivo facilitate. Our annotation system does not involve breaking apart a text and coding it to facilitate interpretation. Instead, users upload sets of shared ethnographic questions. Here is one example of a question set. … Any artifact on the platform can be annotated with any question set. You don’t have to answer all of the questions, and at any point you can add a question. 

:::

##  {background-image="img/annotation.png" background-size="800px"}

::: notes
…but afterwards, we provide different pathways into viewing the plurality of perspectives represented in the platform. For instance, there is a page to see all of the responses to the same question for the same artifact, providing opportunities to visualize the kaleidoscope of viewpoints that emerge around a single data point. We refer to this affordance as collaborative hermeneutics, and for me, this is one of the most important innovations of the system. (I’ll note that this is also the user interface that is my highest priority for redesigning right now; I think there are exciting opportunities for visualizing the responses to questions in more kaleidoscopic ways than lists on web page).  

There are several other design logics that motivate the design of PECE. Inspired by Gregory Bateson, another design logic is about “crossing scales and working double binds” - an explicit effort to highlight where contradictions and paradoxes emerge in the ethnographic research (not to resolve them, but instead to investigate what creates and sustains these disjunctions and how communities creatively grapple with them).

##  Hauntology 

-   Formal ontologies?
-   Semantic Standards?
-   APIs?

:::{.notes}

My personal favorite design logic is inspired by Jacques Derrida; we borrow Derrida’s term “hauntology” to refer to the idea that ontologies are only ever temporarily stable; they can never be fully closed; and there is always some degree of otherness - of what they can’t account for - haunting the system. The question for us became how do we design information ontologies - data models, vocabularies, etc for representing ethnographic data that remain open the absences that are always already haunting the system. Because of this design logic, we’ve always maintained a degree of skepticism when computer scientists show up to our meetings and tell us the “right” way to design our system - that we need to formalize some ontology for representing our database models to ensure that all users are uploading information in the exact same way. We find certain degrees of semantic instability not only acceptable in PECE, but encouraged. Creative or devious uses of our infrastructural affordances keep the experiment alive. Yet, this also has created challenges to imagining how data can be moved across platforms. We would love to be able to move data archived in PECE into more long-term, stabilized archival systems hosted by university libraries (such as the Harvard Dataverse). …but in order to map the data we have in our system into a system like the Dataverse, our data model needs to be rather stabilized. We need the kind of stable “ontology” computer scientists are so keen on pushing on us. We’ve tried to figure out ways to build just enough structure into the system to make these mappings possible while leaving the semantics open to certain degrees of haunting.

# Collaborative

::: {.notes}
On to the C- Collaborative

We believe that ethnographic work is better when it is collaborative. In part this comes from our commitment to exploratory pluralism - the idea that we cannot get to characterizing complexity when only ever doing so from solo-authored perspectives. It also comes from a belief that we should be treating our interlocutors as co-creators of ethnographic materials, thus making the knowledge that they’ve helped to produce available to and credited to them. It also comes from a belief that addressing some of the most complex societal problems will require collective insight from researchers with diverse expertise, demanding that we come up with ways to situate and contextualize the data that we share across disciplines.

For a long time ethnographers have tended to work in isolation. Dominant data cultures in anthropology do not prioritize the sharing of ethnographic data, and many publications in anthropology are solo-authored. Part of our work in imagining the design of the platform came from our own ethnographic analysis of the ideologies moving anthropological communities as we engaged in advocacy around data sharing. Of course, in certain ways, the ideologies that de-prioritize data sharing in anthropology are institutionally-incentivized - with credit and career advancement historically discouraging collaborative work. Hopefully this is changing.  Perhaps most commonly, our colleagues expressed concerns over making data representing vulnerable populations available to the public (a concern that we certainly share, but do not believe serves as an appropriate rationale for never sharing any ethnographic data). Many colleagues also raised concerns about extracting data from the contexts of their production. We heard researchers claim that they would never be willing to share their field notes because those notes were generated through a particular analytic lens honed through years of extended fieldwork and attunement to the nuances of their site’s cultural life. The fear here was that publishing ethnographic data could enable irresponsible interpretations unconditioned by cultural immersion, or worse that, ethnographic data extracted from a field could be misappropriated to misrepresent a vulnerable community. Again, this is a concern we are sympathetic to and share, yet do not believe should inhibit all data sharing in anthropological contexts.

##  {background-image="img/permissions.png" background-size="800px"}


::: {.notes}

Designing information architecture attentive to these concerns meant that we needed to design very nuanced forms of access control into the database model; we had to design a permission system that allowed for very fine-grained levels of access restrictions for every piece of content created on the platform. Perhaps only the ethnographer that created the artifact would have access to view the data; perhaps all and only the researchers that are funded under the same grant have view access. Designing the architecture also meant figuring out how to “contextualize” published data; how to provide opportunities for ethnographers to characterize where the data came from - the interpretive lens that rendered it into a piece of data - without suggesting that there was only one right way to interpret the data. 

:::

##  {background-image="img/rda.png" background-size="1200px"}


::: {.notes}

On all of these accounts we were inspired by work at the Research Data Alliance - a community of researchers attempting to design infrastructures and protocols to reduce the social and technical barriers to interdisciplinary and international data sharing. We became involved with this organization in its early days, representing the data infrastructure needs of the “empirical humanities” in the process. Now quickly we learned that our epistemological commitments differed considerably from many representatives at RDA. At RDA there was a real focus on making scientific “reproducibility” possible through infrastructure that fully documented data provenance. The aim was to design infrastructure that would make it possible to converge on the truth of scientific data by documenting the context of data production so well that others could repeat experiments and verify the results.

## Differing Views on Data Context

It’s notable that the emphasis on “context” was relevant to both the anthropologists we engaged with and RDA. …but different views on context were being rendered. For folks at RDA, context was an easily datafiable thing. Context was treated as something that happened in the background; actions happened within a particular context, clearly demarcating context from human activity. Paul Dourish refers to this as a representationalist view of context, which is embedded in positivist epistemologies. Automatically-generated, standardized metadata is understood to provide the context needed to make reproducibility possible. 

Anthropologists were advancing a different understanding of context; one that treats context as unquantifiable, locally emergent - irreducible to a single site. Dourish refers to this as a more interactionist view of context, rooted in phenomenological epistemologies. …and of course, the rationale for documenting context was directed towards different ends. In trying to figure out how to bring context to our published data, we were not so much aiming to enable reproduction of ethnographic studies - to make it possible to verify the results of ethnographic analysis - but instead to provide enough grounding - enough integrity to the conditions of data production - to make responsible reinterpretation possible. We wanted to make it possible for new perspectives to “thicken” the description of ethnographic data - to allow us to view it in new ways, another turn of the kaleidoscope - without completing divorcing that data from the contexts of its production.

:::

##  {background-image="img/crit.png" background-size="800px"}

:::{.notes}

Architecturally this meant figuring out how to encode “context” without relying on certain standardized, stabilized metadata models. How do we design systems that recognize contextualization as a categorizing moment? - not predetermining what counts as context, not treating context as something that can ever be fully saturated. Letting researchers decide what counts as relevant context to them. We ended up adopting “light” versions of certain metadata standards in our system. For instance, when uploading data to the platform, users are asked to fill out a series of fields that map onto the fields proposed in the Dublin Core metadata model. This is considered one of the “lightest” metadata models and was designed deliberately so in order to be relevant to as many diverse communities as possible. Researchers are asked to document information about the data’s source: when it was created, by whom, in which fieldsite, etc. There is also a field where researchers are asked to leave “critical commentary” about the artifact, offering narrative interpretation of the artifact’s significance. This critical commentary moves with the artifact in every place it could potentially appear on the platform. You can’t link to an artifact without its critical commentary. Critical commentary is a required field. While some users find it time-consuming and annoying to have to fill this out for every piece of data we add to the system, we find it critical for enabling the kind of responsible collaboration we hope the system can facilitate.

# Experimental

In Anthropology as Cultural Critique, one of the books that heralded the linguistic turn in cultural anthropology, Marcus and Fischer (1986, x) wrote: A period of experimentation is characterized by eclecticism, the play of ideas free of authoritative paradigms, critical and reflexive views of subject matter, openness to diverse influences embracing whatever seems to work in practice, and tolerance of uncertainty about a field’s direction and of incompleteness in some of its projects.

:::{.notes}

We’ve attempted to design PECE into a space that embodies an experimentalist spirit - to design it into a space where researchers can engage in play. For instance, one way to pull together data and analyses in PECE is through the design of a series of publications. We designed these publications to be “collage-like.” You can pull from content all over the system and drag and drop that content in creative ways to tell some kind of larger ethnographic story. You can organize them temporally to tell a historical story.


You can organize images into a slideshow with commentary - to walk users through imagery of an ethnographic space. 

 You can organize images into a slideshow - to walk users through imagery of an ethnographic space. …or through what we call “PECE Essays” you can organize any content on the site into a three column layout, surrounded by interpretive text, links to other essays, etc. 
 
I'll note that when I first saw what some people had done with PECE essays, I was shocked. "I didn't know the platform could do that."

Now because we don’t want the system to overdetermine what kind of play can happen, there is inevitably a certain degree of uncertainty and incompleteness designed into our information architectures. The system does not generate these beautiful interfaces for you; it provides the means to archive your data, annotate data, and collage the data, but it doesn’t govern exactly how those processes will go. We have found that people need to be committed to the experiment to really bring content on the system to life. Otherwise they get frustrated and leave. …and part of committing to that experiment involves designing some social infrastructure around projects hosted on each platform. Some projects have developed tools to collaboratively plan what kinds of data they commit to archiving (images, fieldnotes, etc). Some projects have developed protocols for tagging content (defining some “core” terms and then devising some light rules for how to iterate tags). Some projects have developed “style guides” - a series of protocols for information that should appear in every essay, what kinds of images work well as thumbnail images, and how to link to different kinds of essays to facilitate meaningful pathways into data.

Now experimentalism is an ongoing tension for us. Because the uncertainty and incompleteness that facilitates play also can make it difficult to find content in the system and to figure out intended uses of the system. PECE is no longer only used by research communities and it no longer only used by communities that share our theoretical commitments. PECE does not embody recognized best practices when it comes to user experience. It does not script for you how to engage with it. It does not lead you down standardized pathways to find what you are looking for. Some would argue that this inhibits PECE’s accessibility to diverse audiences, and I’m not in disagreement with those arguments. I remain committed to the experiment, but can acknowledge that after a decade of working on PECE architecture (as it has migrated it into more and more diverse communities), I wince a little every time I hear someone recommend to me ways to make the system easier to engage with. …typically their suggestions involve bringing more structure into a system that we’ve intentionally structured for play. For example, we revisit the debate over categorizing content into folders every couple of years. I find myself increasingly wanting to standardize certain fields that users fill out when uploading data so that we can build out more robust search systems and APIs for integrating data across the platforms.

I sometimes even find myself wanting to make certain essays less customizable. Full customizability of user interfaces can produce material that looks terrible on mobile devices and tablets. Keeping true to our experimental commitments while also serving our user base, I think has been the hardest challenge of designing PECE. I consider part of the PECE experiment “staying with the trouble” here.

It is serving as a digital archiving platform the Engaging Science and Technology Studies journal. In designing its architecture, we’ve really tried to take advantage of and at times design against digital affordances to make experimental ethnography possible

While I’ve spent most of this talk describing the theory motivating PECE, my actual day-to-day work with PECE tends to involve a lot more conversations with software developers: “These are the fields that must be attached to every artifact. Critical commentary is a required field. These are the links that must appear on the Homepage. This is how users should link to an annotation. Users should be able to organize content into these three columns. Site administrators should be able to to do/see this, but not that.” Every design directive I communicate to developers is grounded in certain commitments; many of which the design team has debated considerably.

There’s a great deal of translational work that happens in the interstices between theory and digital materiality, and that translational work is active and emergent.

It has to be because there are so many tensions at play in the system’s design. We don’t have the architecture all figured out; we’re building it as we go; it requires creative grappling. Our users' experience today, along with all of the data and interpretations they publish on the platform, embodies these tensions.
